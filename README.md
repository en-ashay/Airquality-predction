# Indoor Air Quality Prediction using Deep Learning

This repository contains code and resources for predicting indoor air quality using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

Indoor air quality is an important factor in maintaining a healthy living environment. Poor indoor air quality can lead to a range of health problems, including respiratory issues and allergies. This project aims to predict indoor air quality using deep learning techniques.

## Data

The data used in this project consists of measurements of various indoor air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5). The data also includes information on temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors that can affect indoor air quality.

## Model

The model used in this project is a deep neural network trained on the data described above. The model takes as input the measurements of the various pollutants and environmental factors and outputs a prediction of the overall indoor air quality.

## Results

The results of this project show that the deep learning model is able to accurately predict indoor air quality based on the input data. Further details on the results can be found in the `results` directory.
